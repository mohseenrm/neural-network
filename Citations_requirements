Network.py:
1. This program slightly  incorporates ideas from tutorial blog and implementation of neural
    network by Michael Nielsen(http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)
2. We also use python-mnist 0.3, standard python library authored by Richard Marko avaialable
    at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-mnist
3. Repo: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

File Name: src/network.py
Used similar approach as in line numbers: 56-60,74-75
File Name: src/mnist_loader.py
Used similar approach as in line numbers to zip pixel values and outputs: 69-74

1. This program slightly incorporates ideas from tutorial blog and implementation of neural
    network by Ottokar Tilk(https://gist.github.com/ottokart/ebd3d32438c13a62ea3c)
2. Gradient difference of 1e-4 is accepted
3. Gist Repo: https://gist.github.com/ottokart/ebd3d32438c13a62ea3c
File Name: nn.py
Used similar approach as in line numbers for implementing gradient check: 85-95

python-mnist 0.3:
We also use python-mnist 0.3, standard python library authored by Richard Marko avaialable at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-mnist
We have used functions available in this library to load the dataset.
